# VRBalance
VRBalance is a Super Monkey Ball clone made for desktop VR and the V-Rod, a novel cane-based interaction device. 

The V-Rod is a rod equipped with a load cell, a microcontroller system for networking the pressure, as well as a place to mount an oculus controller.
Put together, V-Rod can sense its position, rotation, and its pressure on the ground.

VRBalance gives the player the ability to control the axis of the world using the V-Rod. The user must use this to roll themselves through the included levels.
Additionally, a second player can connect on an android phone and drop rocks from the sky in the attempt to block the VR users path or knock them off the sides.
